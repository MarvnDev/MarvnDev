## Contribution and Open Source üåé

I'm proud to be part of an organization of developers called 'No Country.' Their mission is to bridge the gap between junior developers in Latin America and potential employers.

One of my notable contributions includes my role as a backend developer for the 'GreenIX' project within 'No Country.' GreenIX is a web application in the e-commerce sector, with a specific focus on promoting and selling sustainable technologies and appliances. My contributions involved developing and maintaining the backend infrastructure of the application, ensuring its smooth operation, and helping to create a platform that encourages sustainable consumption.

In addition, I'm committed to the principles of collaboration, sharing knowledge, and leveraging the power of open-source software to drive positive change. Being part of these initiatives has not only expanded my technical skills but also allowed me to connect with like-minded developers and contribute to meaningful projects.
